# ### Experiment 1
# ### NeuralRL/Bandit Controllers with NonNeural RL Agents
# #### NeuralRL Controller state input is the average reward across all tasks
# #### NeuralRL Controller does not have inventory as input


# ### Experiment 2.5
# ### NeuralRL/Bandit Controllers with NonNeural RL Agents
# #### NeuralRL Controller state input is the buffer reward across all tasks 
# #### NeuralRL Controller does not have inventory as input


# ### Experiment 3
# ### NeuralRL/Bandit Controllers with NonNeural RL Agents
# #### NeuralRL Controller state input is the average reward across all tasks 
# #### NeuralRL Controller also has inventory as input


# ### Experiment 4
# ### NeuralRL/Bandit Controllers with NonNeural RL Agents
# #### NeuralRL Controller state input is the buffer reward across all tasks 
# #### NeuralRL Controller also has inventory as input
